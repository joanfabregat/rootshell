/// detection.
///
/// A tssh reattach makes the remote redraw from both ends: the app sends a
/// resize jiggle (`TrzszSession.attemptResume`) and tsshd's attach handler
/// does its own unconditionally. The remote answers that repaint with a BEL
/// somewhere in the byte stream. Backgrounded output makes it worse — the
/// core's `GHOSTTY_ACTION_RING_BELL` guard drops bells while backgrounded,
/// but the *bytes* are buffered and replayed once we return, so a whole
/// suspension's worth fires at once. None of those carry information: we
/// asked for the bytes.
///
/// Three lifetimes, because the replays end differently and the consumers
/// need different things from them:
///
/// - **Deadline** (`suppress(_:for:)`) for a bounded forced repaint, where
///   the bytes are already on their way.
/// - **Hold** (`suppress(_:untilDrained:)`) for a gated replay, released on
///   the pipeline's own drain callback. A scrollback restore can hold its
///   gate open until the embedded session reaches `.running`, which is
///   unbounded, so no fixed deadline can cover it.
/// - **Rebuild** (`suppressRebuild(_:)`) for agent detection, which
///   re-classifies from the rebuilt *screen* and so has to see the repaint
///   SETTLE rather than merely start.
///
/// Deliberately `nonisolated`: the trzsz backlog is released from
/// `TrzszGoTransport.flushBackgroundedOutput` on a Go callback thread, and
/// arming has to land *before* those bytes reach the core. Hopping to the
/// main actor first would let the bell win the race.
///
/// Suppressing a tmux -CC gateway covers its panes: the panes are separate
/// surfaces that the gateway's session never sees, so `ringBell()` checks
/// the pane's `tmuxPaneBinding.parentUUID` as well as its own id rather than
/// fanning out at arm time.
